# WEB DEVELOPER BOOTCAMP 2.0 - Colt Steele
******
## Intro:
This is the first course I have taken when I first learn about Web Development World. So far, I am enjoyed learning about it and honestly struggle with all the HTML/CSS properties a lot. 

Although the bootcamp is intended for 10-12 weeks of learning, I try to mark my start and end day to tack my progress.
